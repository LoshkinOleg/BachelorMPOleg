# BachelorMP

Generate a Visual Studio using the CMakeLists.txt provided. Once everything is built, don't forget to move the *.dll's from "thirdparty/libsofa/bin/" to "ExampleApp/bin/" for the ExampleApp to work.
The ExampleApp needs to be built in Release x64 mode, else the build will fail due to modes mismatch.
